# haskr-syntax theme

Haskr is a colorful yet subtle syntax theme for Atom.
Haskr's palette is a highly modified version of Github's syntax on a dark background.

I highly suggest you to use `Source Code Pro` as the editor font, `16px` of font-size and setting `3` as the editor line height. Works best with `Nucleus Dark` UI theme.
